# Automotive-Black-Box-with-Incident-Analysis-and-Driver-Sleep-Detection
Automotive Black Box system that integrates incident analysis, driver sleep detection, and emergency response using C/C++, IoT (ESP32-CAM, Firebase), and Computer Vision

Cloud Integration: Stores real-time data on Firebase for remote monitoring and insights.
Driver Sleep Detection: Utilizes ESP32-CAM and a machine learning model to detect drowsiness with 95.84% accuracy using Edge Impulse.
Emergency Braking System: Detects drowsiness, alcohol consumption, and overspeeding and automatically triggers emergency braking.
Hardware Prototyping: Designed and implemented a working prototype integrating computer vision, IoT, and real-time analytics for enhanced road safety.
